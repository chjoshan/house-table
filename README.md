# House Listings

### To start the app:
Run the mock server.
Please use the mock server that I have provided (I have changed one line in the server to allow CORS and updated the houses.json file to contain the latest data from the actual endpoint)

$ npm install  
$ npm run build  
$ npm start

### Requirements
[x] display table data of houses by vendors  
[x] sorting of data locally and globally
[x] editable price field  
[x] save values 

The app is bundled using webpack and babel.
If you have any questions or if the app does not run as expected please feel free to contact me.
